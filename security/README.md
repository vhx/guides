Security
========

Security is important, and you can't practice these guidelines without
understanding them. Make sure you understand each guideline, why it exists, and
how to follow it.

Failing to follow these guidelines will likely put you, your team, and your
deployed services at risk of compromise or loss of privacy.

Using Passwords
---------------
* Use a unique password for every account you create.
* Use a tool such as [1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) to generate random passwords.
* Avoid sharing passwords in plaintext. If you must share a password in Slack,
  delete the message immediately after you confirm it has been received.

Your computer
-------------
* Use a password for logging in to your machine
* If using a Mac, [use Filevault to encrypt your drive](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204837).
  This prevents your hard drive contents from being read if you lose your computer
